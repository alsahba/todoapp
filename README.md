Under construction!

After installation of docker, you can try the project by running the docker-compose up command.

If you are in a mac machine, java image may cause a problem. You can solve this issue with changing the image with 'arm64v8/adoptopenjdk:15-jre-hotspot'.
If problem still continues, you can disable the new virtualization framework in docker experimental settings.
