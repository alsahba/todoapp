- ELK Stack (Logstash, Kibana, Elasticsearch) (8.1.0)

You can try the project by running in the main directory:

```docker-compose up```

Then you can check out the logs in the kibana ```localhost:5061``` address.
After indexing, you can create data view in the kibana console 
(Stack management -> Kibana -> Data views).
